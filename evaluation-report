a code snippet of the model instantiation (to see which model it is, what parameters,...)
MAE (on training/test)
RMSE (on training/test)
R2 (on training/test)
MAPE (on training/test)
sMAPE (on training/test)
The list of features you've used and how you got it (to quickly understand if you've done data leakage)
Accuracy computing procedure (on a test set? What split %, 80/20, 90/10, 50/50? k-fold cross?)
Efficiency (training and inference time). The fastest the best (sustainability).
